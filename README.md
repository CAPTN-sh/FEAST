# Towards Cognitive Situational Awareness in Maritime Traffic Using Federated Evidential Learning

## Introduction
This repository contains the official implementation of the paper *"Towards Cognitive Situational Awareness in Maritime Traffic Using Federated Evidential Learning"*, submitted for the [CogSIMA 2025](https://edas.info/web/cogsima2025/submissions.html) conference.

We present the **F**ederated **E**vidential Learning for **A**nomaly Detection of **S**hip **T**rajectories (**FEAST**) framework, which integrates Federated Learning and Evidential Learning to provide a privacy-preserving, collaborative, and uncertainty-aware approach to anomaly detection in maritime traffic.

This research has been funded by the German Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport within the project ``CAPTN FÃ¶rde Areal II - Praxisnahe Erforschung der (teil)autonomen, emissionsfreien Schifffahrt im digitalen Testfeld'' (45DTWV08D).

## Requirements
To install all the requirements, one needs to first install:

+ conda
+ poetry
+ flower

A detailed list of the required libraries can be found in:

+ poetry.toml

The proper installation must then be done with poetry and conda.

## Data Splitting Strategy
The dataset used for training and evaluation comprises AIS signals collected from the Kiel Fjord region between **March 24, 2022, and June 30, 2023**. It is partitioned into training and validation sets while maintaining a representative distribution of ship trajectories across different **seasons**. As the dataset is the property of the [CAPTN](https://captn.sh/foerde-areal/) research project and subject to data privacy restrictions, it is not publicly available. Interested users should contact the authors for further inquiries.

### Federated Data Partitioning

The dataset is divided among multiple clients using three partitioning strategies:

- **IID Partitioning:** The dataset is split randomly among clients, ensuring that each client receives a statistically similar subset.
- **Natural ID Partitioning:** Data is grouped based on a specific identifier (e.g., ship ID, trajectory ID) to maintain the natural distribution of trajectories.
- **Dirichlet Partitioning:** Data is distributed using a Dirichlet distribution to simulate **non-IID scenarios**, where clients have varying proportions of data.

### Preprocessing & Outlier Removal

Before partitioning, the dataset undergoes **cleaning and outlier removal** on key features (`speed_c`, `lon`, `lat`) based on quantile thresholds. After cleaning, the dataset is converted into **sequence-based trajectory samples** with a fixed sequence length (`960` time steps).

### Client-wise Seasonal Data Distribution

Each client receives a unique subset of the dataset with varying distributions of **Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter** data. The seasonality of each client's data is shown below:

| Season  | Client 1  | Client 2  | Client 3  | Client 4  |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Spring** | 0        | 119,208  | 1,952,640 | 1,975,680 |
| **Summer** | 1,920,000 | 195,713  | 0        | 0        |
| **Autumn** | 0        | 1,168,264 | 0        | 0        |
| **Winter** | 0        | 758,415  | 0        | 0        |

This federated data partitioning ensures that clients receive **diverse but realistic** AIS trajectory data while maintaining the **privacy** and **distributed nature** of Federated Learning.
